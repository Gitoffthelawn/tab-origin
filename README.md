[Tab Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-origin/)
==============

Have you ever opened a new tab and later wanted to go back to where it came
from, only to realize that the parent tab is long gone?

Maybe that's just me.

Anyway, this addon solves that problem by keeping track of the URL that
originated each tab, so you can return to it with a configurable shortcut
defaulting to cmd/ctrl-shift-u.

It also puts a "Back to Origin Tab" option in the tab browser context menu.

If you like it, leave a review! (only if you like it :D)
